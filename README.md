# Blipshot -Google Chrome Extension
by Davide 'Folletto' Casali

(not yet released, development version, now full copyright, will be BSD in the end)

## REUSABLE COMPONENTS

The screenshotter[.DOM].js library is designed to be reused, please do if you want to make full screen screenshots, until Chrome will implement full page screenshot in its core.

## TODO

* Fix vertical scrollbar evaluation (now it assumes that the page has the scrollbar)
* Fix horizontal scrollbar evaluation (now it assumes that the page hasn't the scrollbar)

## MAY DO

* Try to find a faster way to grab screen parts (directly to canvas?)
* Store images in a local WebSQL database for late retrieval
* Find a way to "download" them in a block (zip?)
